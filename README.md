# Parsing-JSON-Files
Opening the Q3 Solution HTML file in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer reads the JSON file
and shows the patient's medical information. Both the Q3_Solution.html and Q1_Solution.json
have to be in the same directory as I used the fetch API to access the data. I tried to use
python flask to get the JSON file onto a server but was struggling to fetch the data once there.
The serverside.py file shows how I got the JSON file onto the server.
